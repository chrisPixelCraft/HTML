### HTML HW2 Setup and Execution Guide

## Prerequisites:
Ensure that `python3` is installed on your device. If not, you can download it from the official Python website.

## Installing Required Python Packages:
Before executing any scripts, you need to install the necessary Python packages. To do so, run the following commands in your terminal:
```shell
pip3 install numpy matplotlib pandas
```
Note: If you are setting up on a different device, it's essential to ensure that these packages are installed correctly.

## Execution:
Once you've set up the environment, you can run the Python scripts. Navigate to the directory containing the .dat data files and execute the following:
```shell
python3 decision_stump_p10.py
```

Continue for the other files:
```shell
python3 decision_stump_p11.py
```
```shell
python3 decision_stump_p12.py
```


Thank you for following the guide. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the official documentation of the respective packages or consult Python's online forums.
